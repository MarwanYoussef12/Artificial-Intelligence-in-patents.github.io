# Artificial Intelligence in patents
# Description: The objective of this project is to combine 2 APIs or more from IP.com to be able to retrieve different information about the same patent using Python. This would help us in the next phases of the project as it would be the base work for coming up with a tool that searches takes a patent application as an input, retrieve all the information and different aspects about similar published/rejected patents, and output a success rate for the submitted patent.
